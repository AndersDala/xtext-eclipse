# Eclipse Support For The Xtext Framework

This repository contains all Eclipse related code for Xtext, including
 - the general Eclipse support for Xtext languages
 - the Xtext SDK for Eclipse itself
 
## How To Build

Checkout and run `mvn clean install`.

The project depends on some internal projects from [xtext-core](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core) that are not published, so you need to clone and import that repository, too. (See #116)
